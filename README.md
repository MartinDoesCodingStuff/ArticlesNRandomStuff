# Articles And Random Stuff

This repository contains articles about stuff I don't make on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtGCxAzhf_vAGNlE6vHDnQ), mostly because I'm lazy. But also stuff I can't make into a video.

This is also where I put code snippets and random quotes I made up.

These contain articles about random things. From tutorials for my Arduino weather station to making fun of a aircon cleaner's attempt at the English lexicon.
