# Articles And Random Stuff

This repository contains articles about stuff I don't normally make on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtGCxAzhf_vAGNlE6vHDnQ), mostly because I'm lazy to grab the camera or boot up Kdenlive. But also stuff I can't make into a video. (i.e. topics that are hard for me to explain simply on video)

This is also where I put code snippets and random quotes.

## "articles" folder
This folder contains articles about random things. From tutorials for my Arduino weather station (video coming soon) to making fun of a spray-on aircon cleaner's attempt at the English lexicon.

## "code-snippets" folder
As the name suggests, this folder contains code snippets that are too small to have it's own repository. Yes I've heard of gists, and I have plans on using them.
